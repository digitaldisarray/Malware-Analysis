[Here](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware) is a course on malware analysis. I would recommend checking this out before you download any of the samples.

[Here](https://github.com/fdiskyou/malware), [here](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo), and [here](https://github.com/misterch0c/malSploitBase) are repos containing malware and other software for you to LOOK at. Make sure you download them into a virtual machine and NEVER run them on a system that you don't own.

If you are specifically interested in exploit kits, I would look into [this](https://github.com/malwares/ExploitKit) repo.

Finally, [neriberto](https://github.com/neriberto) made a tool called [Hazardous Garbage](https://github.com/neriberto/hg) to quickly download malware samples to look at.
